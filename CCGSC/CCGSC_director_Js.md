// File Path: prime_distributed_projectPrlCc1B V5(10K)/public/director.js
// This script acts as the main controller for the director's dashboard (director.html).
// It handles communication with the WebSocket server, manages the UI updates,
// and displays real-time statistics about the distributed computation.

// --- DOM ELEMENT SELECTION ---
// Here, we get references to the HTML elements we need to interact with.
// Storing them in constants at the top makes the code cleaner and more performant,
// as we don't need to search the DOM for these elements repeatedly.

// document.getElementById('id') is a method to select a single HTML element by its unique 'id' attribute.
const startBtn = document.getElementById('start-btn'); // The "Start Computation" button.
const logDiv = document.getElementById('log'); // The text area for displaying log messages.
const progressContainer = document.getElementById('progress-container'); // The container where individual task progress bars will be added.
const tasksCompletedSpan = document.getElementById('tasks-completed'); // The <span> to show "X / Y" tasks completed.
const runningTotalSpan = document.getElementById('running-total'); // The <span> to show the total number of primes found so far.
const workerCountSpan = document.getElementById('worker-count'); // The <span> to display the number of currently connected workers.

// document.querySelector('selector') is a more versatile method to select the first element that matches a CSS selector.
// Here, we select the <tbody> element inside the element with id="worker-table".
const workerTableBody = document.querySelector('#worker-table tbody');

// --- GLOBAL STATE MANAGEMENT ---
// These variables hold the state of the application.

// Data Structure (DSA): This is an object used as a hash map or dictionary.
// The keys will be the unique `workerId` strings, and the values will be objects
// containing information and status for each worker. This provides O(1) average time complexity for lookups.
const workers = {};

// A constant defining the total number of tasks for the computation. This must match the server's configuration.
const TOTAL_TASKS = 25000;

// A variable to store the cumulative sum of primes found.
// It is initialized as a BigInt (using the 'n' suffix) because the total number of primes
// can easily exceed the maximum safe integer value in standard JavaScript (2^53 - 1),
// which would lead to precision errors. BigInt can handle arbitrarily large integers.
let runningTotal = 0n;

// --- HELPER FUNCTIONS ---

/**
 * A utility function to append a message to the log display area.
 * @param {string} message - The text message to be logged.
 */
const log = (message) => {
    // Appends the new message and a newline character to the existing text content of the log div.
    logDiv.textContent += message + '\n';
    // This line automatically scrolls the log div to the bottom so the latest message is always visible.
    // It sets the vertical scroll position to the total scrollable height of the element.
    logDiv.scrollTop = logDiv.scrollHeight;
};

// --- WEBSOCKET COMMUNICATION SETUP ---

// The WebSocket constructor creates a new WebSocket object, initiating a connection to the server.
// The URL starts with 'wss://' which stands for "WebSocket Secure," the encrypted version of the 'ws://' protocol.
// This is the primary communication channel between the director's browser and the backend server.
// The commented-out lines are examples of URLs used during different stages of development (localhost, local network IP, etc.).
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://ccgsc-director.digitalbd.org/ws'); // Your production server URL

// The 'onopen' event handler is a function that is automatically called when the
// WebSocket connection is successfully established.
socket.onopen = () => {
    // Log a confirmation message to the UI.
    log('âœ… Connected. Registering as Director...');
    // Send a message to the server to identify this client.
    // JSON.stringify() converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string, which is the standard format for WebSocket messages.
    // This tells the server that this specific client is the director and should receive all control-related messages.
    socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'registerDirector' }));
};

// The 'onmessage' event handler is the most critical part of the client-side logic.
// It is called every time a message is received from the WebSocket server.
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
    // The `event.data` property contains the message sent by the server, which is a JSON string.
    // `JSON.parse()` converts this string back into a JavaScript object so we can easily access its properties.
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);

    // Control Flow: A `switch` statement is used to handle different types of messages from the server
    // based on the `type` property of the received data object. This is a clean way to manage different server events.
    switch(data.type) {
        // Case: The server sent a simple log message to be displayed.
