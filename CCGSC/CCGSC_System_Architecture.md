## System Architecture

System architecture represents the conceptual model that defines the structure, behavior, and views of a system[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture). It provides a formal description and representation of a system, organized to support reasoning about the structures and behaviors of the system[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture). Architecture serves as the blueprint that guides system construction, ensuring components function efficiently, reliably, and securely[4](https://www.orientsoftware.com/blog/system-architecture/).
