Single threaded -- Single Task or Single cpu per Core
Multi threaded --   Two thread/cpu per core, two task per Core, one task per thread/cpu
 Concurrency --   One or Two thread/cpu per core, two or more task per Core, multiple task per thread/cpu, taskes are time bound, context switching happens per thread/cpu. Tasks does not executes simultaneously. 
 Parallelism -- tasks Executes simultaneously on multiple cores and on multiple threads/cpu. 

If i have multi processor, Multi core, Multi threaded Processors , when i can use Multi threading and concurrency, or parallelism in C/C++ or C# or Go programming

What is Synchronous and asynchronous operation/execution, what is async/await ?
