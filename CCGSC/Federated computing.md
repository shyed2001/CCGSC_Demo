[[Federated Learning]]






Here’s the straight story, Shyed: **federated computing** is how we let many machines think together without surrendering their private data. It’s the old wisdom of the guild—work locally, share only what’s needed—reborn for our era of cloud, edge, and AI. Below is a complete, technically deep field guide—no fluff, just the gears, bolts, and battle scars—yet with an eye to where this craft is headed.

# 1) Definition & Description

**Federated computing** is a distributed-computation paradigm where multiple independent nodes (devices, data centers, organizations) compute locally and exchange only _derived_ artifacts (e.g., gradients, model deltas, encrypted aggregates, analytics sketches) rather than raw data.  
**Federated learning (FL)** is its AI-specific incarnation: a shared model is trained by aggregating updates computed on each client’s private data; the model travels, the data stays home. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data"))

**Flavors.**

- **Cross-device FL:** massive fleets of phones/IoT; intermittent clients, small local datasets (e.g., Gboard). ([Google Research](https://research.google/blog/federated-analytics-collaborative-data-science-without-data-collection/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federated Analytics: Collaborative Data Science without Data ..."))
    
- **Cross-silo FL:** a few reliable institutions (banks, hospitals) with substantial datasets; stable networking and scheduling. ([litian96.github.io](https://litian96.github.io/assets/slides/fedprox_mlsys20.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "fedprox_mlsys20"))
    
- **Federated analytics:** statistics/metrics computed without centralizing data. ([Google Research](https://research.google/blog/federated-analytics-collaborative-data-science-without-data-collection/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federated Analytics: Collaborative Data Science without Data ..."))
    

**Why it exists:** privacy & regulation (GDPR/HIPAA), data gravity, cost of copying, and competitive boundaries (partners collaborate without sharing raw data). ([GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Art. 5 GDPR – Principles relating to processing of personal ..."), [HHS.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Summary of the HIPAA Privacy Rule"))

# 2) Technical Explanation & Examples

- **Smartphone keyboards (Gboard):** on-device training updates are aggregated server-side; adding differential privacy gives formal guarantees. ([Google Research](https://research.google/pubs/federated-learning-of-gboard-language-models-with-differential-privacy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federated Learning of Gboard Language Models with Differential ..."))
    
- **Hospitals:** cross-silo FL for imaging or risk models across sites without moving PHI. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11484284/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The potential of federated learning for public health purposes"))
    
- **Data collaborations:** AWS Clean Rooms ML lets parties train/score without sharing data/models directly (privacy-enhancing controls). (Not classical FL, but adjacent.) ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.](https://aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/ml/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "AWS Clean Rooms ML"), [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/userguide/machine-learning.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "AWS Clean Rooms ML"))

Core components: **orchestrator** (rounds, sampling), **aggregator** (FedAvg/robust rules), **secure aggregation** (crypto protocols), **registry** (client capability/attestation), **artifact store** (models, logs), **metrics** (quality, drift). Reference SDKs (NVFLARE, Flower, TFF) map cleanly onto this. ([nvflare.readthedocs.io](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/2.6.0/fl_introduction.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What is Federated Learning? — NVIDIA FLARE 2.6.0 documentation"), [flower.ai](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Flower Framework Documentation"), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated?utm_source=chatgpt.com "TensorFlow Federated"))

# 4) Data Flow, Control Flow, & Logic

**Per training round (simplified):**

1. **Server → Clients:** send global model `w_t` + training plan.
    
2. **Client:** trains locally for `E` epochs on private data → computes Δ or gradients.
    
3. **Client → Server:** returns update (optionally DP-noised; optionally masked for secure aggregation).
    
4. **Server:** aggregates updates → new model `w_{t+1}`; logs metrics; schedules next round.
    

Minimal flow:

```
Server: select_clients() → broadcast(w_t) → collect(updates) 
      → aggregate(updates) → w_{t+1} → evaluate() → repeat
```

Secure aggregation masks remove the server’s visibility into each client update while still allowing their sum. ([ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3133956.3133982?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Practical Secure Aggregation for Privacy-Preserving Machine ..."), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04482?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Practical Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning on ..."))

# 6) Security, Privacy, & Compliance

- **Transport & identity:** mTLS, rotating client keys, attestation of trusted execution (SGX/SEV/TDX) for aggregators/clients. ([Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Intel® Software Guard Extensions"), [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/sev.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV)"), [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/sev-snp.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "AMD SEV-SNP for Amazon EC2 instances"))
    
- **Secure aggregation:** hide individual updates from the server; only the sum is visible. ([ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3133956.3133982?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Practical Secure Aggregation for Privacy-Preserving Machine ..."))

([Google Research](https://research.google/pubs/federated-learning-of-gboard-language-models-with-differential-privacy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Federated Learning of Gboard Language Models with Differential ..."))
    
- **Policy fit:**
    
    - **GDPR Art.5 (data minimization)** fits FL’s “don’t ship data” stance, but _model updates can still leak_—use DP, SA, audits. ([GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Art. 5 GDPR – Principles relating to processing of personal ..."))
        
    - **HIPAA**: still PHI—use BAAs, audit trails, encryption in transit/at rest. ([HHS.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Summary of the HIPAA Privacy Rule"))
        
    - **EU AI Act**: high-risk systems need QMS, logs, transparency; GPAI transparency too—plan documentation and monitoring. ([Digital Strategy](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com "AI Act | Shaping Europe's digital future - European Union"), [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/eu-ai-act-11737033?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What's Inside the EU AI Act-and What It Means for Your Privacy"))
