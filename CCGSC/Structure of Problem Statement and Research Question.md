# Structuring Problem Statements and Research Questions in a Proposal

A research proposal typically contains **one overarching problem statement** supported by a brief, logically ordered exposition. Splitting that single problem into several independent “problem statements” risks fragmenting the narrative and diluting its significance.

## 1 Problem Statement

- **Sections** – Most graduate schools expect the statement to sit inside a dedicated section (often titled _Problem Statement_ or _Statement of the Problem_) immediately after the background/literature-gap discussion.
    
- **Paragraphing** – Craft it as **one coherent paragraph of 150–250 words** _or_ break it into **three tightly linked paragraphs** that follow the canonical sequence:  
     1. Context and importance of the problem  
     2. Specific gap or deficiency in current knowledge/practice  
     3. Purpose or desired contribution of the study  
     Either format preserves a single, focused statement while allowing you to elaborate on context, gap and purpose without creating multiple “mini-problems.”
    

Avoid three separate problem statements unless the project is a formally integrated multi-study programme (e.g., a PhD by publication). Leading methodological texts emphasise _cohesion over count_ 2.

## 2 Research Questions

Once the problem is clear, distil it into **one primary research question** plus a small set of analytically linked sub-questions:

- **Typical numbers** – For a master’s proposal: one main question and **two–three sub-questions**; for a doctoral proposal: one main question and **three–four sub-questions** 12.
    
- **Hierarchy** – Sub-questions should map onto key variables/themes that together answer the main question; they are not free-standing queries.
    
- **Placement** – Present the questions in a numbered list immediately after the problem statement section. If the study is mixed-methods, you may group them under _Quantitative_ and _Qualitative_ subheadings, but keep the total count lean to maintain methodological feasibility 1.
    

## 3 Why Brevity and Focus Matter

Academic style guides warn that an inflated set of problems or questions:

- invites scope-creep and over-ambitious data collection 1;
    
- complicates alignment among problem, objectives, methods and analyses 2;
    
- jeopardises timely completion, a common risk flagged in doctoral mentoring studies 3.
    

## 4 Recommended Layout Example

1 Background (literature gap)  
2 Problem Statement (three linked paragraphs under one heading)  
3 Purpose and Objectives (bulleted)  
4 Research Question (1)  
  Sub-question 1a  
  Sub-question 1b  
  Sub-question 1c

This structure satisfies most graduate handbooks while keeping the golden ratio of **one problem : one central question : a handful of sub-questions**.

## Key Take-aways

- **One** problem statement is standard; use paragraphing—not multiple statements—to cover context, gap and purpose.
    
- Limit research questions to what the design can realistically answer: usually one main and two–four sub-questions.
    
- Align every sub-question with a method and eventual chapter to preserve feasibility and coherence.
    

Following these evidence-based conventions will yield a concise, assessable proposal that reviewers can readily map to methods, timeline and expected contributions.

# Research Questions versus Problem Statements

- A **research problem statement** concisely describes the real-world issue your study addresses, explains why it matters, and identifies the knowledge gap that must be closed[4](https://scispace.com/resources/statement-of-the-problem-in-research/).
    
- A **research question** breaks that problem into one or more specific, answerable queries that guide your investigation; it is narrower in scope and phrased as a question rather than a statement[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6322175/)[6](https://www.enago.com/academy/research-problem-statement/).

## Problem Statement Instructions

3. Description of prototype including its originality, innovativeness, special features and indicate strategies to be used that will make
the product competitive.

4. Description of the state of the art including information on similar product available in the market and existing market size.

5.  5. Describe how the developed prototype can contribute to wealth creation, enhance quality of life and create or consolidate new
	industries.

6. If development cost for the prototype is more than the PRGS ceiling, state how you plan to obtain the remaining fund.

7. Provide the activities and potential funding sources to bring the developed prototype to commercialization.

1. **Problem Statement Structure**[4](https://scispace.com/resources/statement-of-the-problem-in-research/)[6](https://www.enago.com/academy/research-problem-statement/)  
    a. Context: Describe the domain and why the problem matters.  
    b. Gap: Identify what existing systems or knowledge fail to address.  
    c. Consequences: Explain negative impacts of leaving the gap unfilled.  
    d. Purpose: State your intended focus or solution approach.
