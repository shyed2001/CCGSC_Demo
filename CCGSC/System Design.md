## System Design

System design constitutes the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flows for a system to satisfy specified requirements[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/system-design-basics-essential-principles-best-practices-shukla-j5tdc)[2](https://www.designgurus.io/answers/detail/what-is-system-design-principle). It represents a fundamental aspect of building software applications and infrastructure that meet specific requirements efficiently and effectively[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/system-design-basics-essential-principles-best-practices-shukla-j5tdc). The discipline involves transforming user requirements into an architecture that optimally satisfies those requirements while considering performance, scalability, reliability, security, and maintainability factors[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/system-design-basics-essential-principles-best-practices-shukla-j5tdc).
