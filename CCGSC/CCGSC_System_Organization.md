## System Organization

System organization encompasses the structured framework that defines operational processes, resource management, and overall functioning within organizational contexts[5](https://www.orgvue.com/resources/articles/an-organisation-is-a-system/). It includes decision-making processes, roles, responsibilities, communication flow, and hierarchy, ensuring efficiency and alignment[5](https://www.orgvue.com/resources/articles/an-organisation-is-a-system/). The organizational system acts as the organization's DNA, shaping workflow processes, culture, and team collaboration to achieve objectives[5](https://www.orgvue.com/resources/articles/an-organisation-is-a-system/).
