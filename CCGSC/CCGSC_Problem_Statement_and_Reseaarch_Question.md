# Thesis core

**Aim**  
Design and evaluate a hierarchical crowd–cloud system that delivers reliable, low-cost throughput on heterogeneous, intermittently connected devices.

**Problem statement**  
Centralized HPC/cloud is costly and underutilizes global idle compute; existing volunteer grids lack robust data movement, verification, offline mode, and VM/app flexibility.

**Research questions**

1. What orchestration policy maximizes throughput under churn and heterogeneity?
    
2. How much redundancy is needed for target error bounds?
    
3. When does P2P data outpace client–server for large inputs?
    
4. What is the cloud-burst threshold that minimizes cost at fixed latency?
5. How to compute the resource usage for various tasks for the Web-Workers and App workers on PC/Desktop/Server and or Mobile and or Only Browser/Tabs ?
    

**Hypotheses**

- H1: Hierarchical dew–cluster–grid with redundancy r≤3 attains ≥80% of ideal throughput on embarrassingly-parallel jobs under 20% churn.
    
- H2: P2P chunking + cache reduces egress by ≥50% vs hub-and-spoke for datasets >10 GB.
    
- H3: WebGPU accelerates browser nodes ≥5× on dense linear algebra vs scalar WASM.
    

**Contributions**  
Architecture, scheduler, verifiable compute protocol, P2P data plane, and open benchmarks with cost/latency/accuracy curves.

**Novelty**  
Unified browser+container+VM execution with offline dew, content-addressed data, lightweight ledger for identity/audit, and redundancy-tuned verification.

# What CCGSC is best at

- Monte Carlo and simulation sweeps
    
- Hyper-parameter search and AutoML
    
- Brute-force and heuristic search
    
- Rendering/encoding and batch vision/NLP pre-processing
    
- Federated analytics on public or low-risk data
    

**How**  
Chunk → distribute via FIFO+priority → P2P fetch → WASM/WebGPU compute → quorum verify → aggregate → continuous requeue on failure.

# Resource pooling reality check

- “One VM that live-adds CPU/RAM/GPU from other hosts” is not practical on commodity hypervisors or the public internet. Use **job-level aggregation**, not **machine-level disaggregation**.
    
- Feasible today:
    
    - CPU/GPU sharing via **task distribution** across many VMs/browsers.
        
    - Remote data via P2P chunks and caches.
        
    - vGPU/MIG only partitions a single physical GPU per host; GPU-over-WAN is niche and latency bound.
        

# Security and verification

- Device identity + reputation.
    
- Deterministic kernels, input salts.
    
- r-replication with majority or SNARK/STARK spot-checks for expensive tasks.
    
- Sandboxing: WASM, containers, VMs; no direct worker-to-uploader contact.
    

# Direct answers

- **Do other volunteer platforms let a user run a daily-use full OS VM that also taps crowd resources?** No mainstream volunteer grid does this. Public clouds do VMs, but not P2P crowd aggregation.
    
- **P2P torrent + lightweight blockchain?** Viable: use content addressing for data; minimal ledger for identity/audit/payments; avoid heavy L1s.
    
- **RDP/Chrome Remote Desktop to “make a cluster”?** Use only for admin/ops. They do not distribute compute. Pair with MPI/Ray/Dask/K8s for actual execution.
    
- **WSL2/Windows Sandbox/VirtualBox/Hyper-V for a local CCGSC?** Yes. Minimal recipe:
    
    - Head: Ubuntu VM (Hyper-V). Install Docker + k3s or OpenMPI + Redis.
        
    - Workers: WSL2 Ubuntu on PCs. Join k3s cluster or OpenMPI hostfile.
        
    - Browser workers: serve a PWA with WebSocket/WebRTC; heartbeat + task pull.
        
    - Open firewall on TCP for scheduler and UDP/TCP for WebRTC STUN/TURN if needed.
        

# Evaluation plan (brief)

- Workloads: π-Monte-Carlo, HPO on CIFAR-10, FFmpeg batch transcode.
    
- Scales: 10→1 000 browser workers + 5 VMs.
    
- Metrics: job makespan, $/task (with or without cloud-burst), redundancy overhead, bad-actor tolerance, egress saved by P2P.
    

# Why continue this thesis

You target a clear gap: reliable, verifiable, low-cost throughput from heterogeneous crowds with offline tolerance. That gap is growing with AI demand and budget constraints.

# Topic Identification

Researching “Crowd Grid Super-Computing”—the practice of harnessing the unused CPU/GPU cycles of large numbers of volunteer devices (desktops, laptops, even mobile phones) to form a massive, loosely coupled computational grid. This paradigm combines elements of Dew, Cluster and grid computing[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_computing), P2P volunteer computing [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_computing) and crowd computing[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_computing) , Cloud computing to tackle problems—from astrophysics and climate modeling to machine-learning training—at scales and costs beyond traditional HPC.

# Problem Statements -
## Problem Statement 1

Despite over 85% of idle CPU/GPU cycles residing on consumer and edge devices, current crowd-grid supercomputing frameworks remain constrained by inefficient torrent-based resource distribution and high coordination overhead, resulting in underutilization of volunteer resources and elevated task latency[1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841675/000110465925049311/arbk-20241231x20f.htm)2. Moreover, integrating conventional blockchain consensus mechanisms into these environments adds 40–60% latency without delivering scalable security across heterogeneous nodes, thereby undermining throughput and deterring platform adoption.

### Problem Statement 2
Application domains such as large-scale AI training and scientific simulations demand hundreds of GPU servers, many-core CPUs, and petabyte-scale storage, entailing capital and operational investments reaching tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. Centralized and cloud-based infrastructures struggle to deliver cost-effective scalability, robust availability, and energy efficiency for these workloads, leaving a critical gap for a decentralized framework that can dynamically aggregate and optimize heterogeneous resources across Dew–Mist–Cluster–Grid tiers while ensuring security and incentive alignment.


Despite widespread availability of idle CPU/GPU cycles on consumer devices, current crowd-grid supercomputing frameworks suffer from inefficient task scheduling, low reliability under dynamic node participation, and inadequate security controls, limiting their scalability, performance, and adoption for large-scale scientific workloads.


# Updated Research Problem Statements and Research Questions

## Problem Statement 1

Despite the vast, untapped pool of idle CPU/GPU cycles on consumer and edge devices—estimated at over 87% globally (Sarmenta, 2001)—existing volunteer and crowd-grid supercomputing frameworks fail to integrate efficient, incentive-based peer-to-peer resource sharing with robust security mechanisms. Torrent-style data distribution reduces central load by up to 95%, yet coordination overhead and unreliable peer churn undermine task throughput (Cohen, 2003). Meanwhile, traditional blockchain consensus adds 40–60% latency and fails to scale to hundreds of thousands of nodes (Christidis & Devetsikiotis, 2016). These deficiencies result in suboptimal resource utilization, high validation costs, and limited applicability to latency-sensitive, large-scale scientific workloads. A unified, hierarchically orchestrated Dew–Fog–Edge–Cluster–Grid continuum with lightweight blockchain security and torrent protocols is needed to achieve low-latency, high-throughput, and energy-efficient decentralized supercomputing.

## Problem Statement 2

Hybrid edge-cloud HPC systems promise energy savings of 50–65% over pure cloud deployments, yet they still rely on centralized orchestration that fails to leverage the heterogeneity and proximity of dew and fog nodes (Elkhatib et al., 2017). Without adaptive, AI-driven scheduling across device tiers, idle micro-clusters and mist nodes remain underutilized, and fault-tolerance suffers under dynamic churn. Moreover, container-based sandboxing approaches introduce 10–20% performance overhead on edge devices (Zambre et al., 2023). A new framework is required that employs decentralized torrent-based data chunking, blockchain-verified task proofs, and If possible Browser-WASM based sandboxing to optimize resource allocation, security, and resilience in a global crowd-grid supercomputing network.

## Problem Statements

1. Despite the proliferation of edge-centric compute platforms such as Theta EdgeCloud [1](https://chainwire.org/2025/06/25/theta-labs-launches-hybrid-edge-cloud-architecture-with-dynamic-supply-demand-gpu-marketplace-to-democratize-access-to-computing/), VeeaEdge [2](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840317/000121390025032215/ea0235151-10k_veeainc.htm), and Duos Edge [3](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1396536/000107997325000555/duos_10k-123124.htm), these systems primarily focus on seamless cloud–edge integration and fail to incorporate a unified Dew–Mist–Cluster–Grid continuum that leverages heterogeneous mobile, desktop, and server-grade resources. This fragmentation leads to suboptimal task scheduling, energy inefficiencies, and limited scalability for large-scale scientific and AI workloads.
    
2. While large-scale distributed infrastructures like the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) [4](https://wlcg.web.cern.ch/welcome-worldwide-lhc-computing-grid) demonstrate the potential of volunteer and institutional resource sharing, they lack incentive-driven participation models and lightweight trust mechanisms (e.g., blockchain-verified transactions, sandboxed execution), resulting in high coordination overhead and vulnerability to churn and security threats.

# Integrating Resource Cost, Optimization, Security, and Availability into Problem Statements and Research Questions

## Context: The Challenge of Resource-Intensive Application Fields

In application domains such as AI/ML model training, scientific simulations, engineering design, and big data analytics, the demand for computational resources—hundreds of GPU servers, many-core CPUs, and petabyte-scale storage—translates into capital and operational costs that can reach millions or even billions of dollars for organizations and research institutes[1](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/gpu-servers-market-123370)[2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-petabyte-how-much-does-cost-2024-s-m-aminul--wbyzf)[3](https://rescale.com/blog/the-real-cost-of-high-performance-computing/). These costs are compounded by the need for high availability, robust security, and efficient resource utilization, which are often unattainable for most institutions using traditional centralized or cloud-based infrastructures[4](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/alliances/us-economics-of-high-performance-computing.pdf)[2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-petabyte-how-much-does-cost-2024-s-m-aminul--wbyzf).

## How to Integrate These Issues into Problem Statements

A well-structured problem statement for your research proposal should explicitly articulate:

- The **magnitude of resource requirements** (e.g., "petabyte-scale storage, hundreds of GPU servers, and many-core CPUs").
    
- The **economic barrier** this creates for organizations and institutes (e.g., "costs reaching millions to billions of dollars").
    
- The **operational challenges** in achieving optimal resource utilization, security, and availability at scale.
    
- The **limitations of current solutions** (e.g., centralized cloud, on-premise clusters) in addressing these challenges.
    

## Example Problem Statement

> "Despite the exponential growth in computational demands for AI, scientific, and engineering applications—necessitating hundreds of GPU servers, many-core CPUs, and petabyte-scale storage—most organizations and research institutes face prohibitive capital and operational costs, often amounting to millions or billions of dollars[1](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/gpu-servers-market-123370)[2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-petabyte-how-much-does-cost-2024-s-m-aminul--wbyzf)[3](https://rescale.com/blog/the-real-cost-of-high-performance-computing/). Existing centralized and cloud-based infrastructures struggle to deliver optimal resource utilization, robust security, and high availability at scale, resulting in underutilized resources, increased vulnerability, and limited accessibility for large-scale, mission-critical workloads. There is a critical need for a scalable, secure, and cost-effective distributed computing framework that can dynamically aggregate and optimize heterogeneous resources across mobile, desktop, and server-grade devices."

## How to Integrate These Issues into Research Questions

Research questions should directly address the core challenges identified in the problem statement, focusing on:

- **Resource optimization**: How can distributed architectures maximize utilization and minimize cost?
    
- **Security and availability**: What mechanisms ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and system uptime in a heterogeneous, large-scale environment?
    
- **Scalability and economic feasibility**: How can the platform scale to meet extreme demands without incurring unsustainable costs?
    

## Example Research Questions

1. **Resource Optimization**  
    "How can a hierarchical, decentralized computing framework dynamically optimize the allocation and utilization of heterogeneous resources (mobile, desktop, server) to meet the extreme computational and storage demands of modern scientific and AI applications, while minimizing total cost of ownership[5](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626203.3670620)[6](https://www.ijcrt.org/papers/IJCRT23A5530.pdf)[7](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2022/6355192/)?"
    
2. **Security and Availability**  
    "What lightweight, scalable security and availability mechanisms (e.g., blockchain-based consensus, distributed replication, sandboxed execution) can be integrated into a global crowd-grid supercomputing platform to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and high system uptime for mission-critical workloads[8](https://scispace.com/pdf/security-in-distributed-system-a-review-perspective-3pfiehdr.pdf)[9](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9337881/)?"
    
3. **Economic Feasibility and Scalability**  
    "In what ways can decentralized, incentive-driven resource sharing models reduce the capital and operational costs associated with petabyte-scale storage and high-performance compute clusters, making supercomputing capabilities accessible to a broader range of organizations and research institutes[3](https://rescale.com/blog/the-real-cost-of-high-performance-computing/)[4](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/alliances/us-economics-of-high-performance-computing.pdf)[2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-petabyte-how-much-does-cost-2024-s-m-aminul--wbyzf)?"
    
4. **Comparative Performance**  
    "How does the proposed decentralized, multi-tier computing platform compare to traditional cloud and on-premise solutions in terms of resource utilization efficiency, security, availability, and cost-effectiveness for large-scale, resource-intensive application fields[5](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626203.3670620)[6](https://www.ijcrt.org/papers/IJCRT23A5530.pdf)[3](https://rescale.com/blog/the-real-cost-of-high-performance-computing/)?"
    

## Rationale and Academic Support

- **Resource Cost and Utilization**: The cost of GPU servers and petabyte-scale storage is a major barrier, with initial investments and operational maintenance often prohibitive for most organizations[1](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/gpu-servers-market-123370)[2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-petabyte-how-much-does-cost-2024-s-m-aminul--wbyzf). Studies show that the true cost of owning high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure is often underestimated, with equipment costs representing only a fraction of total ownership when factoring in electricity, labor, and facilities[3](https://rescale.com/blog/the-real-cost-of-high-performance-computing/).
    
- **Optimization and Scalability**: Distributed and composable architectures can extend available memory and compute at a fraction of the cost of traditional DRAM or on-premise clusters, with little performance penalty, enabling more cost-effective scaling[5](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626203.3670620)[6](https://www.ijcrt.org/papers/IJCRT23A5530.pdf).
    
- **Security and Availability**: Security in distributed systems requires robust models to address concurrency, fault tolerance, and failover, with multi-level security mechanisms and redundancy essential for resilience and data integrity[8](https://scispace.com/pdf/security-in-distributed-system-a-review-perspective-3pfiehdr.pdf)[9](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9337881/).
    
- **Economic Feasibility**: Cloud-based HPC can be 50% more expensive than on-premise solutions for large-scale, sustained workloads, especially when factoring in data egress and high-performance networking costs[4](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/alliances/us-economics-of-high-performance-computing.pdf)[2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-petabyte-how-much-does-cost-2024-s-m-aminul--wbyzf). Decentralized, incentive-driven models offer a pathway to democratize access to supercomputing resources.
