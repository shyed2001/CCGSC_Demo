Front End Page  FEP- Server -Landing Page- 
1. Create an index html page with HTML5. On an online LAN/MAN/WAN/Internet/HTTP  server. [[MVP CCGSC index HTML page Landing Page]]
2. Going to the web page will show the visitor option to join the WebWorker List Que. 
3. May use Session, Session Logs, Cookies, Tokens, Tickets, ID/IP/Mac Log etc. for tracking user activity and presenting specific views to users [[State and identity management]]
4. Option to Let the user put in his system info or he will click a button to detect system info automatically, and my page will try to detect his current software and hardware  system info. 
5. Web-workers will receive points and users will be awarded based on those points.
6.  That index html page will allow visitors enter/enlist into a  list of task uploaders who are allowed to upload or offload tasks to the platform 
7. Title -Cloud Crowd Grid Super computing 
8.  Heading welcome  message  - Grid Cluster Dew super computing, Also get points and convert those points into rewards. 
- Start with a simple structure like a doctype, head, and body, or and optionally maybe, add  buttons to make the joining process interactive.
Add a button for joining the webWorker list que. Visitors will join and will be added to a list and the backend server will periodically send heart beat test ir ping to the worker if they are alive. 
and the Waiting looking for work WebWorker browser [[Computer Web-Browser]] visitors will also periodic messages/ping to the server to let them know whether they are waiting or working or leaving etc

Based on the project's goals and the files provided, the landing page (`index.html`) should serve as a welcoming front door to your **Cloud Crowd Grid Super-Computing (CCGSC)** platform. Its main purpose is to clearly and quickly explain the project and encourage visitors to contribute their computing power.

Here is a breakdown of what the landing page should contain, incorporating the HTML structure I provided earlier:

### Content for Your Landing Page

#### 1. **Main Title and Subtitle**

- **Title:** `Cloud Crowd Grid Super-Computing`
- **Subtitle:** This should be a concise and inspiring tagline. For example: "Join a global network of computers to solve complex problems and earn rewards."
    

#### 2. **Primary Call-to-Action (CTA)**

- This is the most important element. It should be a prominent button that takes visitors directly to the `worker.html` page.
    
- **Button Text:** `Become a Worker & Start Earning` or `Join the Grid Now`
    
- **Link:** This button must link to `worker.html`.
    

#### 3. **"What is CCGSC?" Section**

- A brief, easy-to-understand explanation of the project. Avoid overly technical jargon.
    
- **Example Content:** "CCGSC is a distributed computing platform that harnesses the unused processing power of computers like yours from around the world. By connecting to our grid, your device becomes part of a powerful supercomputer, helping to run large-scale scientific, engineering, and data analysis tasks that would otherwise require expensive hardware."
    

#### 4. **"How It Works" Section**

- A simple, step-by-step guide to reassure users that the process is easy and safe.
    
- **Example Content:**
    
    1. **Join:** Click the "Join the Grid" button. A new tab will open, connecting you to our coordinator.
        
    2. **Receive a Task:** Your browser will be assigned a small piece of a larger computational problem, such as finding prime numbers.
        
    3. **Process:** Your computer will process the task in the background using WebAssembly, without installing any software.
        
    4. **Contribute & Earn:** Once the task is complete, the result is sent back, and you are credited for your contribution.
        

#### 5. **"Current Focus: The Prime Number Challenge" Section**

- Showcasing a tangible project makes the concept less abstract. Your current project is a "Distributed prime calculator".
    
- **Example Content:** "Our current initiative involves calculating prime numbers up to 400 billion. By joining, you will help us tackle this massive mathematical challenge, one task at a time. You can monitor the overall progress and see your own contributions in real-time."
    

#### 6. **"Why Participate?" Section**

- Outline the benefits for the user.
    
- **Example Content:**
    
    - **Be Part of Something Big:** Contribute to meaningful research and complex problem-solving in science and technology.
        
    - **Earn Rewards:** Accumulate points for every task your computer completes, which can be redeemed for future rewards.
        
    - **Zero Installation:** Everything runs securely within your browser.
        
    - **Utilize Idle Power:** Make the most of your computer's resources when you're not using them.
        

#### 7. **Footer**

- Simple navigation links.
    
- **Example Links:** `[Project Vision]` `[How We Ensure Security]` `[View the Director's Dashboard (director.html)]`
